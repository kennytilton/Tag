# mxWeb
A powerful, fast, and delightful Web unframework based on nothing more than HTML, CSS, Ajax, and our underlying [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix) dataflow library.

We have two independent implementations for your consideration, one [ClojureScript](https://github.com/kennytilton/tag/tree/master/cljs/webmx) and one [straight JavaScript](https://github.com/kennytilton/tag/tree/master/cljs). Each sits atop similarly independent implementations of [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix), a generic property-to-property dataflow/reactive library.
