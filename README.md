A powerful, fast, and delightful Web unframework based on nothing more than HTML, CSS, Ajax, and Matrix dataflow.

We have two indepedent implementations for your consideration, one ClojureScript and one pure JavaScript. Each sits atop similarly independent implementations of [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix).

[As of 12/26/2017 I am focused on the CLJS version and the JS version is likely a mess. Please create an issue if you want me to get it working. -hk]
