# tag
A powerful, fast, and delightful Web unframework based on nothing more than HTML, CSS, Ajax, and Matrix dataflow.

We have two independent implementations for your consideration, one [ClojureScript](https://github.com/kennytilton/tag/tree/master/cljs) and one [straight JavaScript](https://github.com/kennytilton/tag/tree/master/cljs). Each sits atop similarly independent implementations of [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix).

[As of 12/26/2017 I am focused on the CLJS version and the JS version is likely a mess. Please create an issue if you want me to get it working. -hk]
